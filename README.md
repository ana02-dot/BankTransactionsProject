# BankTransactionsProject

A C# console application that simulates the core logic of a **banking system**, allowing you to manage people, accounts, and transactions. It’s a great project to practice object-oriented programming, data modeling, and LINQ.

## Key Features

- Create and manage **Person** objects with personal details
- Manage **Account** objects with balance and account types
- (Optional) Add and categorize **Transaction** records
- Use LINQ to query, filter, and summarize data
- Structured with clean, modular C# code

## Project Structure

- `Person.cs` – Represents a customer with fields like `Id`, `Name`, `Email`
- `Account.cs` – Represents a bank account with `Balance`, `AccountType`, and ownership via `PersonId`
- `Transaction.cs` *(assumed)* – Represents a financial transaction
- `Program.cs` – The entry point with logic for running and testing the banking logic

## Technologies Used

- C# (.NET 8 Console App)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- LINQ
- Enum usage (`AccountType`)
- Basic Data Validation
